# SF15to18

SF15to18 is a 15 to 18 ID converter for Salesforce written in F# using .NET core. The tool is intended to run with a script that will pass the current contents of the clipboard as an *argument variable* and then *pipe* the output to the clipboard. **View the example run script.** The script can then be bound to a *shortcut key* enabling you to quickly convert a Salesforce ID within clipboard.
